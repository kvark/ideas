## Music Composer Band

A bone-conducting headband that also scans the brain during music listening. It builds a local profile of the holder, associating the brain image features with received audio signals. The image is then used for reverse play: a special function that allows the device holder to compose the music in their head, while the device records them and allows to store, edit, and play them back later.

Main target audience is music compositor wannabys. Everyone can compose music. No need to learn the music alphabet, structure of sounds, zero preparation. Just listen to music, let the device learn your brain, and then start composing your own!
