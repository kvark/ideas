# Interactive Stream

Imagine a Twitch stream that shows a first person view of man on a future Mars base. The man grows vegetables, builds solar arrays, expands the base, looks at the stars. You can just watch it on, say, Twitch. You can also ask the person to do something specific, like explore a particular canyon, or grow your favorite carrots. You vote for specific actions (or arcs of the story) with your money by contributing to the stream.

On the server side, it's just a server running some kind of a video generation model. The model can be controlled by text and images. It's just busy simulating the world and evolving the story, non-stop.
We can set up multiple streams in different settings: space, underwater, urban, farm, you name it.
