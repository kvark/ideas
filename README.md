# Things I'd like to see happening
- an online discussion platform that treats questions/concerns and choices/answers as first class citizens. It should allow a diverse group of participants to converge to some objective medium, being a forcing function to the process.
  - hopefully solved - http://kvark.github.io/tech/arguments/2020/06/30/technical-discussions.html
- mini-summits where people (who are thoughtful and close enough) would try to brainstorm serious problems that we all experience but can't individually tackle. Like the basic income, global warming, the growing complexity of the Web, etc
