Game dev is ripe for the new generation of AI.

## Enemies

In action and RPG games (less so in strategies), games typicall throw hordes of mindless enemies at us.
Unreal Tournament (from 1998) was a brilliant exception, where engaging more than enemy in a fight was often
a recipe for death. Unfortunately, it didn't start a trend, and the game remains to be an exception.

Recently, developers started experimenting with AI again, trying to learn the player game style and counter it.
For example, Phoenix Point mutates the enemies to adapt to the player tactics.
I believe, there is a big potential hidden here. Enemies that are fewer but more rich and smart, allow
better immersion into the world, and mimic the real life closer.

## NPCs

It's often featured in RPGs that NPCs live their own lives: have jobs, night/day cycle, relations, etc.
This is not enough. We should be able to just emulate them with differently-calibrated deep neural networks.
For example, when I talk to an NPC I should be able to ask a question that is non-scripted, a question
that's going to be understood by the NPC in the context of the game world and answered thoughtfully.
This would be a huge innovation in role playing games, bringing them to the next level.
