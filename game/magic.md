## Matter = Energy concept for Magic

### Basic design/idea

Detailed body map of a mage, be it the protagonist or any other. Casting spells requires mana, which can be obtained from the own body parts/organs, as opposed to being stored separately. There is always a question if casting something is too expensive, if an enemy can be defeated with less sacrifice. Battles are tactical with regards to trade-offs for main body function versus produced effects.
