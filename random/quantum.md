## Quantum-like effects real-life

World is structured in layers of complexity, each emerging from a lower one, bearing different rules and semantics. Surprisingly, some of the higher levels resemble the logic of the lowest (known) level of quantum effects. Here is what I noticed so far.

### Voicing an opinion

We - humans - tend to think about many different things. We gather information associated with a topic, accumulate and process it, but it says in quantum superposition up until we need to form an exact opinion of it, or maybe just voice it. E.g. "Can cats be friends?". When we are asked to voice an opinion, our mind collapses the wave function of what we think of the subject.

Associated effects:
  - After we say something, it's hard to take it back. There is a meaning to it: our mind has irreversibly collapsed on that opinion already. Hence the advice: think before you talk.
  - Sometimes people don't answer a question. In light of the quantum interpretation, this starts to make perfect sense: they refuse to collapse the wave function at that moment. This can be seen as an act of self-preservation for the mind wave function.
  - Brainstorming in a dialog produces a rapid sequence of opinion collapses. It allows progressing quickly through some of the possible mind paths, while losing smaller branches behind. For this reason, we sometimes talk to ourselves.

### Racing the street lights

Consider the distance between two cars moving along the same road to be a quantum state. A street light acts as an observation then:
  - either the leading car stops, thus waiting for the following car to catch up, and continue from the same state
  - or the leading car passes through the light, while the following one stops, thus cementing the separation between cars

### Privacy budget in Web APIs

With the [privacy budget](https://github.com/bslassey/privacy-budget), querying a web API for its capabilities (that affect privacy) is equivalent to quantum observation. The capabilities may be considered to not exist until discovered.
