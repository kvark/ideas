## Reproduction

Understanding the sad state of our society and the planet today requires a lot of knowledge synthesis.
It makes future parents concerned about reproduction, less wanting to have kids.
Ironically, it's also pre-requisite to being able to find and develop solutions to these global issues.
Cleaning the planet, changing the way humans live and cooperate with nature...
So the people who can fix this end up breeding less, and people who don't care - breed more.
This way, next generation will have even less capability to adapt than the current one.
